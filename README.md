**bpfvv** stands for BPF Verifier Visualizer

https://libbpf.github.io/bpfvv/

This project is an experiment about visualizing Linux Kernel BPF verifier log to help BPF programmers with debugging verification failures.

The user can load a text file, and the app will attempt to parse it as a verifier log. Successfully parsed lines produce a state which is then visualized in the UI. You can think of this as a primitive debugger UI, except it interprets a log and not a runtime state of a program.

## Development

- Fork the website repo: https://github.com/libbpf/bpfvv.git

- Clone your fork:
    - `git clone https://github.com/<username>/bpfvv.git`

- Setup node modules:
	- `npm install`

- Develop the app:
	- `npm start`

- Build the app for static testing:
	- `npm run build`

- Serve the statically built app:
	- `npm run serve`

- Format your code:
	- `npm run format`

- If everything is OK, push your branch, create a PR.
